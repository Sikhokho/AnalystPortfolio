Background:
A major food and gas provider has tasked our team with completing a data analysis and presentation to recommend product distribution for their new stores. The data provided includes information on sales offers, store types, and locations across different states.

Problem Statement:
The senior leadership has requested a comprehensive analysis and presentation outlining the recommended offers for each store, taking into account factors such as store type, location, and sales performance.

Objectives:
Determine the ideal offer mix for each store based on sales data.
Provide recommendations for product distribution at new locations.
Create a PowerBI dashboard for visualization and presentation of findings.

Data Cleaning: Utilize Power Query in Excel to clean and preprocess the provided data.
Identify and handle null values.
Standardize store-type labels.
Normalize sales data based on the days the store is open.

Data Analysis:
Analyze sales performance of various offers across different store types and locations.
Group data by store type and location to identify trends and patterns.
Calculate average sales per day for each offer to normalize sales data.

Visualization and Dashboard Creation:
Utilize PowerBI to create a dashboard visualizing sales performance and offer mix for each store.
Present key findings and recommendations through interactive visualizations.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, recommendations will be provided regarding the optimal product distribution for the new stores. Factors such as offer performance, store type, and location will be considered to ensure the recommendations align with the company's objectives and target market.

Store Types:
EDO: Mid-sized store with regular front fuel and an extended diesel offering in the back. These stores are a cross between a 5.5K and a travel center.
Travel Center: Larger Store with front regular fuel stations and back truck fuel stations. They are usually along travel routes. This means they see a lot of traffic from travelers but may not be in populated areas.
5.5K: A regular-sized store with only front regular fuel stations. These are normally located in cities (populated areas) but can be located anywhere.

Conclusion:
Through thorough data analysis and visualization, our team aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to optimize product distribution for the new stores, ultimately contributing to the company's success in meeting customer demands and driving sales growth.
